Jarvis Voice Assistant
Overview
Jarvis is a voice-activated virtual assistant built using Python, leveraging various libraries to perform tasks like setting reminders, fetching weather information, controlling applications, and more. This project is inspired by the voice assistant system seen in movies like Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S.

Features
Speech Recognition: Convert spoken words into text using the SpeechRecognition library.
Text to Speech: Convert text responses into speech using the pyttsx3 library.
Weather Updates: Fetch weather information using requests and OpenWeatherMap API.
Task Automation: Launch applications, perform web searches, and open websites via voice commands.
Personalized Reminders: Set and notify reminders based on user input.
News Updates: Fetch news headlines using web scraping or news APIs.
